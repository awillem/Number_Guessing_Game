# --------------------------------

This project required creating a Number Guessing Game.  The script should run without errors.  There should be a welcoming game intro, a random number is set, and the player is asked continuously for a guess until they guess correctly.  With incorrect errors, the player should be told if their guess was higher or lower.  At the end of the game, they should be told how many attempts it took, and be given an ending message.  

For an exceeds grade, the player should be told if their guess is outside of the range possible (if the range is 1 to 10, and the player guesses 12), after winning they should be prompted if they would like to play again, at the start of the game, the current high score (at least points) should be shown, and a new random number is selected each time.  

Additional features I added:
* Gather and use player's name, both in the display and scores
* Added difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
* High scores include players name, and are shown based on the difficulty selected for the current game.
